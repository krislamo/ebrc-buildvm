## EBRC-BuildVM

This repository contains a building script for the [vagrant-puppet](https://github.com/krislamo/vagrant-puppet) project. Notably, this may include personal idiosyncrasies for VEuPathDB BRC Puppet development that other administrators may or may not find consistent with their workflow.

### Install
1. Clone this git repository under `vagrant-puppet/scratch`,<br />
   i.e., `vagrant-puppet/scratch/ebrc-buildvm`

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:krislamo/ebrc-buildvm.git
    ```
2. Symbolic link to `buildvm.sh` script

    ```
    cd ebrc-buildvm
    sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/buildvm.sh" /usr/local/bin/buildvm
    ```

3. Set the environment in `ebrc-buildvm/env/main`. Sample:

    ```
    # Vagrant settings + Puppet init override
    VAGRANTBOX=vagrant-puppet_default_X
    VAGRANTSNAP="Working SAVM"
    VAGRANTBRANCH=ksavm
    INITOVERRIDE=mytests

    # Symlinking for quick Puppet apply, i.e., buildvm -a ./vagrant-puppet
    declare -A MODULES
    MODULES[profiles]="/vagrant/scratch/puppet-profiles"

    # For ssh-keyscan on internal repos used for r10k deploy
    GIT_HOST=git.example.org
    GIT_PORT=22
    ```
4. Run `buildvm` against the `vagrant-puppet` directory
    ```
    buildvm -b ./vagrant-puppet
    ```

### Options
By default, the `buildvm` script will apply any overrides (see INITOVERRIDE) or syncing (see FROMSCRATCH) and ensure the VAGRANTBRANCH is checked out on puppet-control, puppet-hiera, and puppet-profiles. Additionally, for puppet-profiles, the script will ensure you're working with an up-to-date branch by rebasing on master.

Additional options:
* `-a` - Run puppet-apply against the virtual machine. Use alone for a quick puppet-apply for already symlinked Puppet modules.
* `-b` - Builds the VM from a snapshot, deploying Puppet with r10k, symlinking select modules, and running puppet-apply. Sets options: `-rdla`
* `-d` - Deploy your Puppet environment using r10k-deploy inside the VM. Use with `-l` to ensure module symlinks are restored after deploying.
* `-e` - Set the ebrc-buildvm environment file, i.e., `ebrc-buildvm/env/$ENV`â€”defaults to `main`.
* `-l` - Remove select modules defined as keys in the `MODULES[]` array and replace them with symlinks to its value for a quick puppet-apply.
* `-r` - Restores a VM to a previous snapshot before applying any other options.



### Environment
Different `ebrc-buildvm` environments allow you to switch which virtual machine, snapshot, and Puppet environment you're using for development. This is accomplished using bash shell variables set inside a file named after the environment. For example, the default environment named "main" is configured in the `./env/main` file.

To use other environments, pass the name of the environment to the `-e` flag, i.e., `buildvm -e otherenv`

##### Variables
* `VAGRANTBOX` - The name of the virtual machine used for provisioning.<br/>
  - Find the name using:<br/>
    `vboxmanage list vms | awk '{print $1}'`

* `VAGRANTSNAP` - The name of the virtual machine snapshot the build is based on.<br/>
  - Find the snapshot name using:<br/>
    `vboxmanage snapshot "$VAGRANTBOX" list | grep Name`

* `VAGRANTBRANCH` - The name of the puppet environment and branch names used for git checkouts.
  - The following repositories are assumed to have this branch name: `puppet-control`, `puppet-hiera`, `puppet-profiles`. Additionally, the Puppet environment used for provisioning is expected to have this shared name.

* `FROMSCRATCH` (OPTIONAL) - A directory to copy data from into the `$VAGRANTDIR/scratch` directory
  - If this option is set, the script will rsync data from the specified location into the vagrant-puppet4 scratch directory. This is useful for saving disk space (via hard links) for multiple virtual machines and centralizing Puppet code editing.

* `INITOVERRIDE` (OPTIONAL) - A subdirectory at `puppet-control/manfiests/$INITOVERRIDE/` to move init.pp files
    - This setup requires a slight modification to `puppet-control/manifests/site.pp` to include a subdirectory with a `init.pp` file.<br/>e.g.,
      ```
      node default {
        include mytests
      }
      ```
    - In the example above, `INITOVERRIDE=mytests`
    - This allows for a centralized directory of multiple `init.pp` files for different virtual machines. The option will remove `puppet-control/manifests/$INITOVERRIDE/init.pp` and replace it with `puppet-control/manifests/$INITOVERRIDE/$VAGRANTENV-init.txt` automatically before provisioning.
    - Do not place data into the `$INITOVERRIDE/init.pp` file directly with this set.
